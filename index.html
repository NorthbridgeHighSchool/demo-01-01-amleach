    <h1>Basketball</h1>
    <p> Basketball is my favorite sport because of how diverse it is. You need many physical skills to be good at it including mental skills as well. Basketball is a much more creative sport than most sports. There are so many diffrent styles and ways to play the game. Every player has their own techniques and unique playing style. </p>
    <p> Some players thrive on defense others strive on offense. It all depends on how you like to play. Smaller guys tend to be shooters because they don't always have the height to drive to the basket. Where as bigger players aren't always as good as shooters and tend to play more defense. </p>
    <p> More reasons why I enjoy basketball so much is the electricity and atmosphere games hold. Basketball arenas are inside and much more compact than say and MLB stadium or an NFL stadium. It's times when it's a close game or a player hits a game winner that you feel like no other sport can beat basketball. </P>
